/*
 * Changes to a mod folder that wait until OpenXWA doesn't read its files: a
 * new import of the mod, and a delete.
 *
 * A new import of a usable mod goes to its staging folder,
 * <parent>/.openxwa-update/<folder name>. XwaModUpdate_Apply then swaps the
 * folders: the old mod goes to <parent>/.openxwa-trash/<folder name>, and the
 * staging folder takes its place. A mod marked for deletion has a
 * .openxwa-delete file in its folder, and XwaModUpdate_DeletePending moves
 * it to the trash folder. The trash is deleted in the background
 * (XwaModUpdate_StartCleanup).
 *
 * Only folders whose mod.yaml comes from the importer are moved or deleted.
 * Each step leaves a state that the next call recognizes, so a swap that
 * stops halfway is finished or undone at the next start.
